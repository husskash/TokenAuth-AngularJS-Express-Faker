This small playground is to have a token server side authentication with fake users emulated.
to make it work you should:

1- execute in the terminal the json-server for the fake data generated by faker js: #json-server app/faker/generate_users.js

2- execute the server.js for the node server with express: nodemon app/server/server.js

3- go with the browser to localhost:3000/users and select a random user 

4- authenticate with username and password of that user



if you want to include data to the token please go the server.js and add properties there (I advise only user id and access level)
